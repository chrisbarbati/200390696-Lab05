            <h2>Biography:</h2>
                <p class="b">
                    I was born in 1998, in Toronto at Women's College Hospital.
                    I attended St. James elementary school and St. Thomas Aquinas secondary school.
                    I was briefly in the Engineering program at Western University,
                    before deciding it wasn't for me. I like building things, but
                    I did not want to do math all day.
                </p>
                <p class="a">
                        <img src="images/portrait.jpg" alt="An image of a young man, his head facing the camera and
                        his body slightly turned to the left. He is wearing a black t-shirt, and has dark hair & glasses.">
                    I then came to <em>Georgian College</em> and enrolled in the BBML program,
                    of which I completed about three semesters before transferring
                    to <em>York University's</em> Economics program. 
                    Ironically, I <em>still</em> ended
                    up in a program where I did math all day.
                </p>
                <p class="b">
                    I completed my degree in Economics this summer, and recently started
                    the CMPA program at <em>Georgian College</em>. I have some amateur experience in
                    programming, but have always had trouble taking my skills to the next
                    level on my own. I'm hoping that I can grow my abilities and gain
                    experience through the co-op periods, then start a career in programming.
